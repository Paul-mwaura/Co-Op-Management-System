# NITK Co-Op Management System

## TO CREATE AN ONLINE SHOPPING FACILITY FOR THE COOPERATIVE SOCIETY OF NITK

## Problem statement:
Finding an alternative to the existing system of cooperative society and making it more efficient for everyone.

## Abstract:
* In the era of digitalization a successful consumer store requires a facility that will bring up more costumers to their stores, which is possible if it is able to provide an extra comfort to its upcoming customers. Other than good quality and reasonable prices, what if people could save their time and energy too.
* When people want things pertaining to their daily needs in a given frame of time, there is no option other than reaching the store itself, which is a tedious job. Also the online shopping stores cannot provide us that facility and that too in a given time bound. Along with that what if there is a small queue awaiting you at the store and you are in a hurry. Also, what if you donâ€™t know the approximate amount that  you will need to purchase the thing that you wish. 
* So the solution and our main idea is to provide to the students, staffs and residents  of NITK an online shopping and delivery facility linked with the girls as well as the boys cooperative society of NITK  which will decrease the stress of their tedious schedule and provide them with things of their daily use that they wish to purchase at their doorsteps and that too in a limited time.
* The things that will help us achieve the aim of the problem is a real time app in addition to a  website that will let us know the prices as well as the availability of the items that we wish to purchase rather than reaching to the co-op and finding out that the item is not actually available. Also we will have a delivery system that will provide them with the service just at their doorsteps with both cash on delivery as well as online payments through their accounts with us.So people can select the items that they wish to purchase and just buy and get it delivered too.
